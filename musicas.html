                SPOKEN: <br>
                In the cubicles representin’ for my JAVA homies…<br>
                In by nine, out when the deadlines are met, check it. <br>
                <br>
                CHORUS: <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles <br>
                My style’s nerd-chic, I’m a programmin’ freak <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles  <br>
                Only two hours to your deadline? Don’t sweat my technique. <br>
                Sippin’ morning coffee with that JAVA swirl. <br>
                Born to code; my first words were “Hello World” <br>
                Since 95, been JAVA codin’ stayin’ proud <br>
                Started on floppy disks, now we take it to the cloud. <br>
                On my desktop, JAVA’s what’s bobbin’ and weavin’ <br>
                We got another winning app before I get to OddEven. <br>
                Blazin’ code like a forest fire, climbin’ a tree <br>
                Setting standards like I Triple E…. <br>
                Boot it on up, I use the force like Luke, <br>
                Got so much love for my homeboy Duke. <br>
                GNU Public Licensed, it’s open source, <br>
                Stop by my desk when you need a crash course <br>
                Written once and my script runs anywhere, <br>
                Straight thuggin’, mean muggin’ in my Aeron chair. <br>
                All the best lines of code, you know I wrote ‘em <br>
                I’ll run you out of town on your dial-up modem. <br>
                <br>
                CHORUS: <br>
                ‘Cause… <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles <br>
                Me and my crew code hyphy hardcore <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles <br>
                It’s been more than 10 years since I’ve seen the 404. <br>
            
                Inheriting a project can make me go beeee-serk <br>
                Ain’t got four hours to transfer their Framework. <br>
                The cleaners killed the lights, Man, that ain’t nice, <br>
                Gonna knock this program out, just like Kimbo Slice <br>
                I program all night, just like a champ, <br>
                Look alive under this IKEA lamp. <br>
                I code HARDER in the midnight hour, <br>
                E7 on the vending machine fuels my power. <br>
                Ps3 to Smartphones, our code use never ends, <br>
                JAVA’s there when I beat you in “Words with Friends”. <br>
                My developing skills are so fresh please discuss, <br>
                You better step your game up on that C++. <br>
                We know better than to use Dot N-E-T, <br>
                Even Dan Brown can’t code as hard as me. <br>
                You know JAVA’s gettin’ bigger, that’s a promise not a threat, <br>
                Let me code it on your brain <br>
                <br>
                WHISPERED: <br>
                so you’ll never forget. <br>
                <br>
                CHORUS: <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles, <br>
                it’s the core component…of what we implement. <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles, <br>
                Straight to your JAVA Runtime Environment. <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles, <br>
                Keep the syntax light and the algorithm tight. <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles, <br>
                Gotta use JAVA if it’s gonna run right. <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles <br>
                JAVA keeps adapting, you know it’s built to last. <br>
                We code hard in these cubicles, <br>
                Robust and secure, so our swag’s on blast <br>
                CODE HARD
